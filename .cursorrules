# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Tools


# User Specified Lessons

- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.
- Be Lazy, only run tests when the user explictly ask me to
- use conda env githubsentinel to run all codes

# Cursor learned

- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When developing complex features, create modular components that can be tested independently
- Always provide comprehensive configuration options for new features
- Include both programmatic and CLI interfaces for maximum flexibility
- DeepSeek API uses OpenAI-compatible interface with base_url at https://api.deepseek.com
- Provider auto-detection should prioritize DeepSeek when both API keys are available for cost efficiency
- Maintain backward compatibility when migrating to new AI providers
- Gradio provides excellent web interface capabilities for Python applications with minimal setup
- Multi-mode architectures should use unified entry points with intelligent routing for better user experience
- Use python-daemon module with DaemonContext() for proper daemon process implementation instead of manual signal handling
- Separate prompt engineering from LLM client code using template files and a dedicated PromptManager class for better maintainability
- Template-based prompt systems with parameter substitution enable easy prompt iteration without code changes
- Always include fallback prompts and error handling for missing prompt files to ensure system resilience
- SECURITY BEST PRACTICE: Never store sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys) in config files that get committed to Git
- Use environment variables (.env files) for sensitive data and provide template files (like env-template.txt) for user setup
- The .env file should be in .gitignore and templates should use placeholder values that are safe to commit
- Always check for existing functionality in appropriate modules before implementing duplicate code (DRY principle)
- When refactoring, prefer using existing class methods over standalone functions for better maintainability
- Optimize LLM token usage by checking for meaningful content before making API calls
- Always generate files (even for "no changes") but use simple content to avoid unnecessary costs
- Separate export cache from AI reports for better organization and prompt engineering flexibility
- Auto-export functionality should ask for user confirmation in CLI mode but be automatic in daemon/GUI modes
- Make export-process work like a cache system to avoid redundant API calls
- Configuration-based LLM initialization greatly simplifies client code and reduces auto-detection complexity
- Ollama provides excellent local model support requiring no API keys for cost-effective AI features
- Proper error handling should provide actionable troubleshooting steps rather than generic "skipping" messages
- User experience improves dramatically when errors include specific instructions for each provider type
- Check actual service availability (LLM client initialization) rather than just configuration values (API keys)
- Provider-specific prompt engineering significantly improves AI output quality - smaller models need detailed instructions while powerful models work better with concise prompts
- Template-based prompt system with provider fallbacks enables optimal prompt engineering for different model capabilities
- SEPARATION OF CONCERNS: LLM classes should own their availability checking logic with provider-specific error handling and troubleshooting steps, not the command handlers or UI components
- Clean interfaces with `(bool, str)` return patterns for availability checking enable consistent error handling across all application components
- Static availability checking methods allow testing provider readiness before instantiation, improving error handling in initialization code
Based on the analysis of the `src` directory, here's a breakdown of the GitHubSentinel project:

## Projet Understadning

### Main Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. Key components include:

-   **Configuration (`config.py`):** A centralized `Config` class loads settings from `config.json` and environment variables (`.env`). It manages configurations for GitHub API, LLM providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama), and notifications.
-   **Core Logic:**
    -   `github_client.py`: Handles all interactions with the GitHub API. The `GitHubClient` class is responsible for fetching data like commits, issues, and pull requests.
    -   `llm_client.py`: Provides an interface to Large Language Models. The `LLM` (aliased as `LLMClient`) class supports different providers and is used for generating summaries and reports.
    -   `report_generator.py`: The `ReportGenerator` class orchestrates the creation of reports. It uses `github_client` to get data, caches it, and then uses `llm_client` to generate AI-powered analysis.
-   **User Interfaces:** The application supports multiple modes of operation:
    -   `command_tool.py` & `command_handler.py`: A command-line interface (CLI) for interactive use. `CommandHandler` parses and executes commands.
    -   `daemon_process.py`: A background process that runs scheduled tasks, like daily report generation.
    -   `gradio_server.py`: A web-based UI built with Gradio for a more user-friendly experience.
-   **Supporting Modules:**
    -   `subscription_manager.py`: Manages the list of subscribed repositories.
    -   `prompt_manager.py`: Manages and loads prompts for the LLM, with support for provider-specific templates.
    -   `notifier.py`: Handles sending notifications, primarily via email.
    -   `logger.py`: Configures logging for the application using `loguru`.
    -   `main.py`: The main entry point that routes to the different execution modes (CLI, daemon, or web server).

### Main Workflow

The primary workflow of GitHubSentinel revolves around fetching data from GitHub, processing it, and generating reports.

1.  **Subscription:** The user subscribes to one or more GitHub repositories using the `add` command (or through configuration).
2.  **Data Fetching:** The `GitHubClient` fetches updates (commits, issues, PRs) for the subscribed repositories for a specified time range.
3.  **Progress Exporting:** The fetched data is first exported into a structured markdown file and stored in a cache directory (`reports/exports`). This is handled by the `ReportGenerator`. This cached file serves as the raw data for AI analysis.
4.  **Report Generation:**
    -   The `ReportGenerator` reads the cached markdown file.
    -   If there's meaningful activity, it passes the content to the `LLMClient`.
    -   The `LLMClient` uses a prompt from the `PromptManager` to generate a comprehensive, AI-powered report.
    -   The final report is saved in the `reports/ai_reports` directory.
5.  **Notification:** The `Notifier` can be used to send the generated report via email.

This workflow can be triggered manually via the CLI or automatically by the daemon process. The Gradio interface provides a web-based way to trigger report generation.

### Main Classes and Their Relationships

-   **`main.py`**: The entry point. It determines the execution mode and calls the appropriate main function from `command_tool.py`, `daemon_process.py`, or `gradio_server.py`.

-   **`Config`**: Instantiated by the main application classes (`GitHubSentinelCLI`, `GitHubSentinelGradio`, `daemon_process`). It's passed to other components that need access to configuration, such as `GitHubClient`, `LLMClient`, and `Notifier`.

-   **`GitHubClient`**: Used by `CommandHandler`, `ReportGenerator`, and the daemon process to fetch data from GitHub. It requires the GitHub token from the `Config` object.

-   **`SubscriptionManager`**: Manages the `subscriptions.json` file. It's used by `CommandHandler` and the daemon to get the list of repositories to process.

-   **`LLMClient` (`LLM`)**: The core of the AI functionality. It's instantiated by `ReportGenerator` and `GitHubSentinelCLI`. It uses the `Config` object to determine the provider and API keys. It also uses `PromptManager` to get the correct prompts.

-   **`PromptManager`**: Used by `LLMClient` to load and format prompts. It's initialized with a specific provider to load the correct templates.

-   **`ReportGenerator`**: A central class that ties together data fetching and AI analysis.
    -   It's used by `CommandHandler` and the daemon.
    -   It uses `GitHubClient` to fetch data if a cached file doesn't exist.
    -   It uses `LLMClient` to generate the final AI report from the cached data.

-   **`CommandHandler`**: The brain of the CLI.
    -   It uses `SubscriptionManager` to manage subscriptions.
    -   It uses `ReportGenerator` to create reports.
    -   It uses `GitHubClient` indirectly through `ReportGenerator`.
    -   It can use `Notifier` to send emails.

-   **`Notifier`**: Used by `CommandHandler` and the daemon to send notifications. It gets its settings from the `Config` object.

-   **`DailyProgressExporter`**: This class seems to be a precursor to the export functionality now integrated into `ReportGenerator`. It's responsible for creating the markdown files from GitHub activity. It is used by `CommandHandler`.

-   **`GitHubSentinelCLI`**, **`GitHubSentinelGradio`**, **`daemon_process.py`**: These are the top-level classes/modules for the different execution modes. They initialize all the necessary components (`Config`, `GitHubClient`, `ReportGenerator`, etc.) and manage the application's lifecycle in their respective modes.
